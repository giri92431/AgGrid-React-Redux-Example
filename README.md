<h3>Data Grid Exapmle using react AgGrid and handsontable</h3>   

<h3>benefits</h3>

 1.One command to get started - Type npm start to start development in your default browser.
 
 2.Rapid feedback - Each time you hit save, changes hot reload and linting and automated tests run.
 
 3.One command line to check - All feedback is displayed on a single command line.
 
 4.No more JavaScript fatigue - Slingshot uses the most popular and powerful libraries for working with React.
 
 5.Automated production build - Type npm run build to do all this
 
 <h3>Technologies stack:</h3>
 
 Javascript ES6 : simple to use and  reduces dependence  
 
 React  : Fast, composable client-side components.
 
 Redux : Enforces unidirectional data flows and immutable, hot reloadable store. Supports time-travel debugging.
 
 Redux-thunk : Redux Async Libraries.
 
 React router : A complete routing library for React
 
 Babel :Compiles ES6 to ES5. Enjoy the new version of JavaScript today.
 
 Webpack : Bundles npm packages and our JS into a single file. Includes hot reloading via react-transform-hmr.
 
 Browsersync: Lightweight development HTTP server that supports synchronized testing and debugging on multiple devices.
 
 jest: Automated tests with built-in expect assertions and Enzyme for DOM testing without a browser using Node.
 
 Trackerjs : JavaScript error tracking.
 
 ESLInt : Lint JS. Reports syntax and style issues. Using eslint-plugin-react for additional React specific linting rules.
 
 SASS : Compiled CSS styles with variables, functions, and more.
 
 PostCss : Transform styles with JS plugins. Used to autoprefix CSS
 
 EditorConfig : Enforce consistent editor settings (spaces vs tabs, etc).
 
 NPm Script : Glues all this together in a handy automated build

      echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p
    
    4.On Windows:
      Install Python 2.7 or greater 
        Some node modules may rely on node-gyp, which requires Python on Windows.
      Install C++ Compiler. 
    
    5. npm run setup
    
    6. npm start -s [ -s is an optional paramatr which will stop the extra noice in the comand line ]
